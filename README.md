# My Dog Park Scheduler Project for Bootcamp

This is a React app for creating and managing appointments for dog owners. The app includes multiple components, such as the Entry component, which is a form where dog owners can input their name, their dog's name, and an appointment date. The Schedule component displays a table of existing appointments and allows users to edit or delete appointments. The app uses useState hooks to manage user input and display updates. Additionally, the code includes functions for formatting dates and sorting appointments by time.
